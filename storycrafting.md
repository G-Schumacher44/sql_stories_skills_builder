## üéØ Purpose

This document explains how each SQL Story in this repo is created using a mix of synthetic data generation, structured business framing, and AI-assisted scenario design. The goal is to simulate realistic business questions and data challenges that strengthen SQL and analytical fluency.

---

## üß¨ Data Generation Strategy

All stories are powered by a dataset produced using the companion project:

‚û°Ô∏è [`ecom_sales_data_generator`](https://github.com/G-Schumacher44/ecom_sales_data_generator)

That repo provides:
- Modular Python scripts for data simulation
- Scenario-based YAML configurations
- Controlled injection of data messiness

üóÇÔ∏è This Repository includes [db_builder.zip](ecom_data_gen_output/db_builder.zip)

The output includes:
- Clean CSVs for each table (`orders`, `order_items`, `returns`, etc.)
- A zip archive with loading assets:  
  `ecom_data_gen_output/db_builder.zip`

Inside that zip:
- `*.csv` files (one per table)
- `load_data.sql` to construct the schema and load into SQLite

### üß™ Mess Injection (Realism Tuning)

The data generator supports configurable ‚Äúmess‚Äù levels:
- `none`: perfectly clean, ideal for baselines or learners
- `medium`: includes nulls, case issues, date shifts, return spikes
- `heavy`: simulates real-world chaos ‚Äî fuzzy joins, data mismatches, and edge-case outliers

This messiness emulates POS systems or early-stage data warehouses where governance is still maturing.

>included database was configured with a `meduim` mess injection.

## ü§ñ AI's Role in Story Design

AI acts as a **co-author and validator**, helping shape business scenarios around each dataset. Contributions include:

- Business context and stakeholder goals
- Analytical framing and key metrics
- Prompt engineering for SQL challenges
- Narrative tone and documentation

AI helps keep every story grounded, engaging, and useful ‚Äî from beginner tutorials to portfolio-grade projects.

---

## üì¶ Story Format

Each story lives in its own folder, e.g. `story_03_product_profitability/` and includes:

- A `scenario_XX_name.md` brief describing the context and goals
- `queries.sql` containing core analysis queries
- `load_data.sql` and supporting CSVs
- Optional: dashboards, Jupyter notebooks, QA notes

---

## üîÑ Reusability

Every scenario is modular and remixable:
- Regenerate data with updated YAML for infinite variety
- Extend queries into notebooks or dashboards
- Fork scenarios into cleanup, reporting, or advanced SQL exercises

---

## üå± Why This Matters

Real analysts deal with:
- Unclear business questions
- Messy, mismatched data
- High expectations for clarity and insight

These stories replicate that ‚Äî helping you build SQL muscle in realistic contexts with just the right level of friction.

> _Every scenario is a mini sandbox for growing analytical confidence and narrative clarity._
